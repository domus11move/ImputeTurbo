\usage{
SimEval(
  data,
  task = NULL,
  p = 0.1,
  n.sim = 100,
  ini = "mean",
  method = NULL,
  guess = FALSE,
  guess.method = NULL,
  other = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE,
  seed = 1234
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{is the complete data matrix that will be used for simulation}

\item{task}{task type, either be 1 for regression, 2 for classification or 3 for
mixed type}

\item{p}{is the percentage of missing values that will be introduction into
data, it has to be a value between 0 and 1}

\item{n.sim}{the number of simulations, default is 100 times}

\item{ini}{is the initialization setting for some relevant imputation methods
, the default setting is "mean", while "median" and "random" can also be
used. See also \code{\link{guess}}}

\item{method}{the imputaion method based on variable selection for simulation
some other imputation method can be passed to the 'other' argument}

\item{guess}{logical value, if is TRUE, then \code{\link{guess}} will be used
as the imputation method for simulation}

\item{guess.method, }{guess type for the guess function. It cannot be NULL if guess is TRUE}

\item{other}{some other imputation method that is based on variable selection
can be used. The requirement for this 'other' method is strict: it receives
a data matrix including missing values and returns a complete data matrix.}

\item{verbose}{logical, if TRUE, additional output information will be provided
during iterations, i.e., the method that is using, the iteration number,
the convegence difference as compared to the precious iteration. The
progression bar will show up irrespective of this option and it can not be
got rid of.}

\item{seed}{set the seed for simulation so simulations using different imputation
methods are comparable. The default value is set to 1234, which is not supposed to
mean anything. But if 1234 is used, then the seed for simulating the first
missing data matrix is 1234, then it sums by one for every subsequent
simulationg data matrix.}
}
\value{
a list of componentes including

 \item{task}{the name of the task}
 \item{time}{computational time}
 \item{error}{the imputation error}
 \item{conv}{the number of iterations to converge}
